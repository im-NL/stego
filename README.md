# STEGANOGRAPHY 
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video

# OUR PROJECT
We found a way to hide messages inside images in a simple, efficient and fast way. The best part about it is that the images that we encode with this tool look ``virtually transparent``, this means that even though there is a messsage in the image, nobody can notice or identify that there is a message hidden within the photo unless they inspect it rigorously. 

# USES
Our tool could have endless uses in many different areas. It could be used anywhere where messages need to be secretive or .It can be used by armies to convey secret messages online, as nobody would suspect a virtually transparent image. Ciphers were actually used in World War 2 germany to send messages, they used something called an enigma machine to encode and decode their messages. ``Google Enigma Machine`` or ``Collosus Computers`` for more information on that.
