Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video

# THE PROJECT
This is a way to hide messages inside images in a simple, efficient and fast way. The best part about it is that the images that we encode with this tool look ``virtually transparent`` (not in the current version but if you roll back and download the code from the 2022 versions you'll find the transparent image code as well), this means that even though there is a messsage in the image, nobody can notice or identify that there is a message hidden within the photo unless they inspect it rigorously.
